Example List:
Let's consider the list 
5
,
3
,
8
,
7
,
2
,
6
5,3,8,7,2,6 as the "larger elements" list extracted from the initial pairing process.

Visualizing the Recursive Sorting Process:
The recursion process divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges them back together. Here's how it works for our example list:

Initial Call:
recursiveSortLarge([5, 3, 8, 7, 2, 6], 0, 5)
This is the initial call to sort the entire list.

First Level of Recursion:
Divides the list into two halves:

Left half: recursiveSortLarge([5, 3, 8], 0, 2)
Right half: recursiveSortLarge([7, 2, 6], 3, 5)
Second Level of Recursion:
Each half is divided further:

Left half is divided into: recursiveSortLarge([5, 3], 0, 1) and recursiveSortLarge([8], 2, 2)
Right half is divided into: recursiveSortLarge([7, 2], 3, 4) and recursiveSortLarge([6], 5, 5)
Third Level of Recursion:
The division continues until sublists cannot be divided further (i.e., they contain a single element or two elements that are then sorted directly):

For [5, 3], it gets sorted into [3, 5] through further recursion and merging.
[8], [7, 2], and [6] are considered already sorted (single elements or sorted in a subsequent recursive call).
Merging Back Together:
The sorted sublists are merged back together at each level of recursion:

[3, 5] is merged with [8] to form [3, 5, 8].
[2, 7] (after sorting [7, 2]) is merged with [6] to form [2, 6, 7].
Finally, [3, 5, 8] and [2, 6, 7] are merged to form the fully sorted list [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8].
